# Letter-Recognition
 A letter recognition program that uses handwriting data from the MNIST database and trained with the Java Neuroph AI package.

 Currently not trainable via github due to the training data being too large for github (emnist-digits-train-images-idx3-ubyte - 179MB)
 Program should run normally with the .nnet files though (they contain the trained neural network weights).

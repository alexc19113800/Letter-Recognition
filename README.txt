Due: 4/30/2018 as final project for honors AI.
NOTE: The main class of the project is "Runner.java"

All classes starting with "Mnist" were coded by Ralf Th. Pietsch and were used in this project simply to help me read the MNIST dataset.
Gaussian blur kernel, maxpooling, and other techniques were discovered through google and wikipedia.
